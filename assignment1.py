        """
        Interpolate the function f in the closed range [a,b] using at most n
        points. Your main objective is minimizing the interpolation error.
        Your secondary objective is minimizing the running time.
        The assignment will be tested on variety of different functions with
        large n values.

        Interpolation error will be measured as the average absolute error at
        2*n random points between a and b. See test_with_poly() below.

        Note: It is forbidden to call f more than n times.

        Note: This assignment can be solved trivially with running time O(n^2)
        or it can be solved with running time of O(n) with some preprocessing.
        **Accurate O(n) solutions will receive higher grades.**

        Note: sometimes you can get very accurate solutions with only few points,
        significantly less than n.

        Parameters
        ----------
        f : callable. it is the given function
        a : float
            beginning of the interpolation range.
        b : float
            end of the interpolation range.
        n : int
            maximal number of points to use.

        Returns
        -------
        The interpolating function.
